## Scrimba HTML/CSS final project

https://tom-hometown-guide.netlify.app/

Task set by Scrimba to produce a "hometown guide page". Completed ahead of moving onto JavaScript. 

Satisfied with some of the concepts included on the page. The hover and shadow effects are effective. 
The layout is clear, I think avoids clutter. I have managed to learn and include features I was not aware of previously
such as the .hero::before and z-index: 1.
