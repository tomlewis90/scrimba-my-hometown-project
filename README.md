# scrimba-my-hometown-project

##Scrimba HTML/CSS final project

Task set by Scrimba to produce a "hometown guide page". Completed ahead of moving onto JavaScript. 

Satisfied with some of the concepts included on the page. The hover and shadow effects are effective. 
The layout is clear, I think avoids clutter.
